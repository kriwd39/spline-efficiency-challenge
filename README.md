# Spline Efficiency Challenge - Coca-Cola Bottle Reconstruction

## Objective
Digitally reconstruct a classic Coca-Cola bottle using a pure spline-based modeling workflow. The goal is to achieve visual accuracy with maximum efficiency and elegance, demonstrating deep understanding of spline behavior, control point placement, and curve continuity.

## Reference
For an objective, time-invariant standard, refer to the orthographic drawing of the classic Coca-Cola bottle design patent D48,273:

## Workflow
This repository documents the entire modeling process using GitHub features:
1. **Project Initialization** – This README and reference.
2. **Planning & Scoping** – Issue for deconstructing bottle into spline components.
3. **Modeling & Versioning** – Branches for spline profiles, exported vector files, and modeling documentation.
4. **Submission & Review** – Pull request with final model, renders, and technical justification.

## Progress
- [x] Create repository and set up reference
- [ ] Create project plan issue
- [ ] Create branch and profile curves
- [ ] Model bottle splines
- [ ] Export vector files and document process
- [ ] Finalize and submit via pull request
